# Java-Exam-Grader 

A command-line interface (CLI) tool which grades exams and prints a formatted output to both the console and to a text file displaying each studentâ€™s name, information about the class/test, and their grade.

This program was completed as a final project for my Object-Oriented Programming course which I took in the fall of 2022.

## Compiling & Running the Program

One way to compile and run the program for youself is as follows:

1. Clone the repo to your device
2. Open a command prompt in the newly-created Java-Exam-Grader folder
3. Compile using the following command:

```batch
javac Grading/TestGrading.java -p Grading/
```

4. Lastly, run the program using the following command:

```batch
java Grading/TestGrading -p Grading/
```
